# Description

This course addresses the numerous ways in which we produce, analyze, and experience data. Throughout the course, students will be asked to think critically about where data come from, what biases and assumptions data contains, and will learn to tell stories with data in a variety of media forms. Students will learn to identify and employ novel data generation processes, will gain experience with tools and techniques for data analysis, and will develop experimental approaches to visualize, represent, and communicate meaningfully using data.

*Work will be evaluated on the quality of concept, the degree of experimentation (both aesthetic and technical), and final realization (again, aesthetic and technical). Prompts and rubrics will be provided with more specific details regarding each assignment and breakdowns

## Description of Assignments and Exams

__*Weekly Exercises*__
We will have regular, weekly programming assignments employing the tools and techniques covered in class. These will be short activities with clearly stated creative prompts and technical requirements. Projects will be graded on satisfactory completion with additional credit for creative, technical, expressive extension beyond requirements.  

__*Projects*__
We will have two projects over the semester. Project 1 will focus on archives, cultural analysis, and visualization—curating datasets and telling stories through visualization or other experiential communication. Project 2 will focus on data-driven and generative art, where students use data to create new generative media based off of contemporary ML and data-driven processes, considering fact and fiction and the role of synthetic outputs based on real experience. For Project 3 students will revisit a previous exercise or project from the course and refine it as a project. 

For each project students will submit a project archive containing a statement of concept, source code, links to data resources, documentation of the work, discussion of results, and future directions. When assigned, students will submit a proposal/concept for their project to receive instructor feedback, and then work to complete the project. Projects will be presented and critiqued in class and project archives will be submitted for grading.

__*Participation*__
Contributions to class discussions and active participation in small group work are essential to both the momentum of the course and the development of your ideas. This requires that you come to class prepared (having completed assigned reading and writing) and ready to participate in class activities. This course is based on collaborative, project-based learning and you are also expected to contribute as a responsible member of a group. See the participation evaluation in the Grading Scale below for more information. 

## Attendance
On-time attendance is required as well as playtesting inside and outside of section. Please notify your instructor in advance if you must be absent for illness or family emergency. Any absences must be cleared with the instructor, or justified with written documentation (e.g. letter from team, etc.). We do not differentiate between mental and physical health and in either case please be in communication for when you need to take a day off. After a student misses a week’s worth of classes each subsequent missed class will result in the reduction of the final grade by a full letter grade (i.e., A to B, B- to C-) Excessive tardiness or leaving early will also impact your grade and will follow the same rubric.

Please also note the JCSTF attendance policy:
- 4.7 Attendance Policy
- 4.7.1 After a student misses an equivalent of one week’s worth of classes, each subsequent missed
class will result in the reduction of the final grade by a full letter grade (i.e., A to B, B- to C-).
- 4.7.2 Students may be granted an excused absence at the instructor’s discretion.
- 4.7.3 Students may be granted an excused absence, at the instructor’s discretion, to allow those students to participate in extra-curricular events representing the University. In such cases, the instructor must be notified in advance.
- 4.7.4 This policy, as approved by the faculty, represents the minimum requirement. Faculty members are permitted to develop more stringent attendance requirements, as long as those requirements are detailed in writing in the class syllabus and distributed at the beginning of each course.
- 4.7.5 The policy on students who are late to class will be left up to the individual instructors.

## Late work policy
An assignment may receive an F if a student does not participate in every phase of the development of the project and meet all deadlines for preliminary materials (proposals, drafts, etc.). Failure to submit any of the graded course assignments is grounds for failure in the course. If a final draft or project, plus required addenda, is not submitted in class on the date due, it will be considered late and will lose one letter grade for each day or part of a day past due (A to B, etc.). Assignments are due in hard copy and or via email/link (online assignment). You must submit your assignments directly to the instructor. Any late submissions must be approved by your faculty instructor well in advance of the due date.

## Grading Scale
A+ = 97-100 A = 93-96 A- = 90-92
B+ = 87-89 B = 83-86 B- = 80-82
C+ = 77-79 C = 73-76 C- = 70-72
D+ = 67-69 D = 63-66 D- = 60-62
F =below 60%

Here is a description of the kind of participation in the course that would earn you an A, B, C, etc. Your instructor may use pluses and minuses to reflect your participation more fairly, but this is a general description for each letter grade.

A – Excellent
Excellent participation is marked by near-perfect attendance and rigorous preparation for class. You respond to questions and activities with enthusiasm and insight and you listen and respond thoughtfully to your peers. You submit rough drafts on time, and these drafts demonstrate a thorough engagement with the assignment. You respond creatively to the feedback you receive (from both your peers and instructors) on drafts, making significant changes to your writing between the first and final drafts that demonstrate ownership of your own writing process. Finally, you are an active contributor to the peer- review and collaborative writing/making processes.

B – Good
Good participation is marked by near-perfect attendance and thorough preparation for discussion section. You respond to questions with specificity and make active contributions to creating a safe space for the exchange of ideas. You submit rough drafts on time, and these drafts demonstrate thorough engagement with the assignment. You respond effectively to the feedback you receive (from both your peers and instructor) on drafts, making changes to your work between the first and final drafts. You are a regular and reliable contributor to the peer-review and collaborative writing/making processes.

C – Satisfactory
Satisfactory participation is marked by regular attendance and preparation for class. You respond to questions when prompted and participate in classroom activities, though you may sometimes be distracted. You are present, with few absences, and have done some of the reading some of the time. You submit drafts on time and make some efforts toward revision between the first and final drafts of an assignment. You are involved in peer-review activities, but you offer minimal feedback and you may not always contribute fully to the collaborative writing/making process.

D – Unsatisfactory
Unsatisfactory participation is marked by multiple absences from section and a consistent lack of preparation. You may regularly be distracted by materials/technology not directly related to class. You submit late or incomplete work and revise minimally or only at a surface level between drafts. You are absent for peer-review activities, offer unproductive feedback, or do not work cooperatively in collaborative environments.

F—Failing
Failing participation is marked by excessive absences, a habitual lack of preparation, and failure to engage in the drafting, revision, and collaborative writing/making processes.

## Academic Honesty Policy

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course. Any instances will result in an automatic grade of F in the course and possible disciplinary action under the Student Code of Conduct (https://studentconduct.unl.edu/student-code-conduct). For information on the University’s policy on academic dishonesty, please refer to the current Undergraduate Bulletin (https://registrar.unl.edu/academic-honesty).

We will use many open source projects to make our work. It is ok to use others' code. However, **you need to cite your sources**, and **you need to do transformative work/make it your own**.

# Policies

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact their instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation based on a current accommodation plan. It is the policy of the University to provide flexible and individualized accommodations to students with documented disabilities including those students with mental health disabilities such as depression and anxiety.

## COVID-19 face covering policy
Required Use of Face Coverings for On-Campus Shared Learning Environments*

As of July 17, 2020 and until further notice, all University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL) faculty, staff, students, and visitors (including contractors, service providers, and others) are required to use a facial covering at all times when indoors except under specific conditions outlined in the COVID-19 face covering policy found at: https://covid19.unl.edu/face-covering-policy

This statement is meant to clarify classroom policies for face coverings:

To protect the health and well-being of the University and wider community, UNL has implemented a policy requiring all people, including students, faculty, and staff, to wear a face covering that covers the mouth and nose while on campus. The classroom is a community, and as a community, we seek to maintain the health and safety of all members by wearing face coverings when in the classroom. Failure to comply with this policy is interpreted as a disruption of the classroom and may be a violation of UNL’s Student Code of Conduct.

Individuals who have health or medical reasons for not wearing face coverings should work with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (for students) or the Office of Faculty/Staff Disability Services (for faculty and staff) to establish accommodations to address the health concern. Students who prefer not to wear a face covering should work with their advisor to arrange a fully online course schedule that does not require their presence on campus.

As of January 12, 2021 (https://covid19.unl.edu/spring-testing) and until further notice, students, faculty, and staff are required to get a COVID-19 test during the week of January 19 – 24 and at least one additional, follow-up test around 10 days later. Proof of a negative test result (via the Safer Communities smart phone app or an official, printed pass from the Safer Communities web client) is required to gain entry to the Carson Center building. Students are also required to adhere to an updated Cornhusker Commitment (https://covid19.unl.edu/we-are-cornhusker-committed) for the Spring 2021 semester.

Students in the classroom:
1. If a student is not properly wearing a face covering, the instructor will remind the student of the policy and ask them to comply with it.
2. If the student will not comply with the face covering policy, the instructor will ask the student to leave the classroom, and the student may only return when they are properly wearing a face covering.
3. If the student refuses to properly wear a face covering or leave the classroom, the instructor will dismiss the class and will report the student to Student Conduct & Community Standards for misconduct, where the student will be subject to disciplinary action.

Instructors in the classroom:
1. If an instructor is not properly wearing a face covering, students will remind the instructor of the policy and ask them to comply with it.
2. If an instructor will not properly wear a face covering, students may leave the classroom and should report the misconduct to the department chair or via the TIPS system for disciplinary action through faculty governance processes.
     
*Courses that have been granted an exception to the Face Covering Policy for pedagogical reasons are excluded. Exceptions to the Face Covering Policy are only granted after an approved health safety plan is developed.
